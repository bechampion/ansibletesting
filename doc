#Run playbooks
ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts -K (for sudo password)

#facter
ansible all -m setup

#hiera
use variables

#get stdout
register: varname
and then use it as 
{{varname.stdout}}

#run it somewhere else
delegate_to: 127.0.0.1

#iterations:
vars:
	myvars: [1,2,3,4,5]
task:
	name: myloop
	command: /bin/echo {{item}}
	with_items:
		- "1"
		- "2"
		- "{{myvars}}"

#funny jinja maps
command: /bin/echo {{motd}} {{item|map('upper')|join}}

#debugging
- debug:
	msg: "hola que tal {{myvariable}}"


#sudo
become_user: root
become_method: su

#Variables
they should be relative to the host group
[group]
127.1.1.1

so they can go in a file under
group_vars/virtual (no yaml required)
and the content should be something like

---
variable: pepe

#templates
Super simple Task:

 - name: "testing template" 
      template:             
        src: templates/demo.j2
        dest: /tmp/pepinos

and the jinja template looks like:

Hola {{variable}} like normal jinja


#vault encryption couldn't be more simple...
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/virtual
to encrypt a variable file..

and then add this to the ansible-playbook command:
--ask-vault-ass 

Extremely Simple.

#Dinamic Inventories
To load hosts and groups from a script .. 
add -i script.py

script has to return:
on --list -> json.dumps({"group" : {"hosts":[1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2],"vars":{"ansible_ssh_port":5222}}})
on --host -> json.dumps({}) // or host specific variables.


#Debugging
Something handy that this thing has from version 2.1
adding "strategy:  debug" outside the task definition lands us on a debugging shell , in case we try to do something with a variable that
doesn't exist we can do
> p result 
prints the exception

> p task.args
prints the arguments of the task as in 
{u'_raw_params': u'echo {{wrong_var}}'}

and we can do inline magic as in
task.args['_raw_params'] = "echo 1"
this changes the task completely

>redo

to re execute the playbook... interesting


## important variables 
When you do a loop within a task such as

command: stat {{ item }} 
with_items:
    - "{{groups['all']}}" # BE SURE THERE is NO SPACE BETWEEN THE QUOTES AND THE {{


# with_lines # it will apply the task to all the lines captured in the with_lines statement.
- name: o"fake loop"
  command: stat "/tmp/{{ item }}"
  with_lines: ls /tmp


#replacing multiple lines on a file
- name: "replacing test"
  lineinfile:
    dest: /home/jegarcia/Projects/ansible2/testfile
    regexp: "{{ item.regexp }}"
    line: "{{ item.line}}"
  with_items:
    - { regexp: 'dog' ,  line: 'Dog' }
    - { regexp: 'cat' ,  line: 'Cat' }
#something interesting about loops
So loops like with_items are a characteristic of the task itself and not of the task module (such as replace,lineinfile)
this means that every task can be looped and it's attributes can be populated with {{ item.name }}

for example
tasks:
- name: "demo task"
  doingsomething:
    val: "{{item.val}}"
  with_items:
    - { val: "pepe" } 

if that makes sense.
